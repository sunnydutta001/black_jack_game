# black_jack_game
I have made the Black jack game using python. This was a part of my Capstone Project. In this game i have used all the python lessons that i have learned in the past 10 days. Enjoy the game!

#How to play:
If your first 2 cards add up to 21 (an Ace and a card valued 10), that’s Blackjack! If they have any other total, decide whether you wish to ‘draw’ or ‘stay’. You can continue to draw cards until you are happy with your hand.
